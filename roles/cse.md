# Cloud Security Engineers(CSEs)

Our Cloud Security Engineers (CSE) are one of the most diverse and multi-skilled functions in Form3.

## The Team 
From securing the SDLC alongside our software engineers to segmenting the network of our Cloud-Agnostic platform, our CSEs are always at the forefront of our security strategy.\
We are extremely lucky to have a team that have converged from many a background including, software engineering, penetration testing, appsec, network security and security architecture, giving us an ecliptic approach to defending our landscape.\
This also offers all team members to learn and develop their personal skill-sets through the information sharing and experiences of others. 


## The Role
Here are some of the exciting key projects/workloads our CSEs take on: 
- Creating a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC).
- Securing our cloud-native (AWS and GCP) distributed system architecture.
- Creating security tools and implementing them to enhance our specific security landscape.
- Advocating the DevSecOps mindset that we have created across our engineering teams.
