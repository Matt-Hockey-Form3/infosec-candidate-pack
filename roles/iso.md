## The Team
Far from the average GRC function, our team of skilled individuals in InfoSec navigate us through a range of Security Frameworks to ensure compliance internally and externally, manage the Cryptography at Form3, and review all new and existing architectures at all stages of development. This team of 13 InfoSec Officers are at the pinnacle of payment security. 

* Researching and strategizing the compilatory requirements of new locations Form3 will be moving into, mapping current controls to new frameworks and working with engineering to define new ones.  

* Managing the audits both internally and externally with our auditors encompassing; ISO27001, SOC1/2, GDPR, PCI-DSS and ISAE3000 to name a few. Collecting and presenting evidence prior to and through out, then actioning recommendations with the wider security team and business to further Form3's Risk Management roadmap.  

* Maintaining the PKI infrastructure and managing the key change process with a range of clients, including Tier 1 Banks through to start-ups.
