# Defensive Engineering:  

## The Team

Responsible for the Platform, Container and SDLC Security, this team is essential in elevating Form3â€™s security posture. The team is compiled of 25 engineers and counting with 5 lead engineers (all internally hired) and a Head of Defensive Engineering (internally hired). Between them they are split across projects including:  

* SecDevOps Coaching; taking ownership of a development arm and working through implementing, tools, best practices and methodologies to increase knowledge within our teams and the maturity of the products/services.  

* Assessing cloud security across our growing public cloud platforms (AWS,GCP, Azure), working with native and third-party tooling to create secure architectures and robust services.  

* Hardening our vast microservice architecture, implementing a range of container security tools and also researching and increasing Kubernetes security through a range of techniques with the latest technology.  

* Developing our internal arsenal of security tools including a OSS DAST tool that is now running across our CI/CD pipelines.
