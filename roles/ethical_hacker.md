# Offensive Security:  

## The Team

We understand we are a target, you donâ€™t move millions of capital daily without attracting some attention, this is where our offensive security team come in. Split into two designated areas; Pentesting and Red Teaming, this team are focused on testing and pushing the boundaries of what our security units can achieve. With our team of 5 in-house OffSec Engineers, we aim to put our security function through simulated-attacks that rival the most sophisticated APT groups.   

* Conducting Penetration Tests across the entire estate on both new and existing products, using external testing for audit purposes only, this team are the go-to for ensure our services are meeting our standards.  

* Devising plans, scoping, creating and executing advanced Red Team operations, including custom malware and C2 development.  

* Researching and developing new attack methods on cutting edge technology to increase the bar for security within Form3.
